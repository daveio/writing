Generally, a sufferer will pick up an annoying viral illness (often infectious mononucleosis, known as 'glandular fever' in the UK, or 'Mono' in the States). That will clear up, but for reasons unknown the body will experience a postviral syndrome. The first time it hits you, it's like having all of your energy taken away from you, and you feel like every organ in your body is shutting down.

Chances are that I never will be. Fortunately, leaps and strides have been made in convincing people, especially GPs, that CFS/ME exists. The EU have ratified it as a disability.

Even when that happens, I'll be drowsy and confused, and not necessarily understand that the alarm is going off. It's like being the drunkest that you've ever been. If I've got someone sharing my bed, I'll have asked them the previous night to do what they can to wake me up when the alarm fires. If I'm on my own, I'll have to hope that one of the five different alarms that I have, staggered by a few minutes each, wakes me up.</p>\n<p>When I'm conscious, I will have a headache and it won't be a trivial one.

The registrar for over 45 million domain names in 2010, it's four times bigger than its closest competitor. GoDaddy is cheap and easily accessible, and it's the first name that many people think of due to their extensive advertising in mainstream media, including the Superbowl.</p>\n<p>Its policies are also written by people who are either ignorant, amoral or both.</p>\n<h2 id=\"outrightsexismatthesuperbowl\">Outright Sexism At The Superbowl</h2>\n<p>GoDaddy has a history of advertising at the Superbowl. The single most watched television event in America, advertising costs for a spot are known in the industry as <em>fucking bonkers</em>.</p>\n<p>GoDaddy also has a history of thinking that 70s-grade sexism is still okay.</p>\n<p>Here's 2009's advert, starring some women with some breasts (and, as far as I can tell, that's the extent of their purpose) -</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"345\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/Uh5fTKI-rQM\" width=\"420\"></iframe>\n<p>Here's one from 2010, featuring a woman with some truly great aspirations; to have her breasts used to sell domain names -</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"345\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/yJc5RldnzIk\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n<p>And they didn't forget about 2011. Hah! The joke's on you! She's old and ugly! Old women are less attractive, which is why it's funny! Hah! -</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"345\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/J83EQ7LubwE\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n<p>By now, I think you're probably noticing a theme. Do you really want to support a company that has no qualms about putting stereotype-solidifying crap like this out there?</p>\n<p>Maybe sexism's not enough for you. Alright, how about this. <em>Their services are intentionally impaired.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"godaddydnsbrokenbydesign\">GoDaddy DNS: Broken By Design</h2>\n<p>When you buy a domain name, it's useless in itself without one or more nameservers associated to it. These servers translate hostnames - like <code>www.google.com</code> - to IP addresses that your computer and Internet connection can use, like <code>62.149.40.4</code>. Without a response from these servers, when you try to send email, visit a website or access any services on that domain, there is absolutely no information about which server your machine should talk to to get the information.</p>\n<p>DNS is important. Without it, your domain name is worthless.</p>\n<p>So it came as quite a surprise when R.

    "html": "<div class=\"kg-card-markdown\"><p>The misuse of the word 'banter' in recent months has been incessant. Dave, a TV comedy channel that carries material from the intelligent to the reprehensible, has even used it as part of its branding. Used as a noun or verb, the dictionary definitions are -</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>banter(n): the playful and friendly exchange of teasing remarks.</p>\n<p>banter(v): exchange remarks in a good-humoured teasing way.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Seems fairly reasonable. British interaction between established friends is quite commonly peppered with the gentle exchange of insults and teasing, with the expectation of the exchange being mutual.</p>\n<p>The thing is, 'banter' (a word that I despise every time I type it) has become less and less good-humoured. Outright misogyny and threats of violence, when called out by those inclined to do so, are dismissed as 'banter', which apparently now makes them okay. Jeremy Clarkson's frequent tirades of bullshit are a perfect example. The number of times that I've been told, &quot;oh, it's just banter&quot;, in the sense that classifying it as such renders it exempt from a critical eye, are numerous and just as infuriating each time.</p>\n<p>Here are a few choice examples of Clarkson's 'banter'.

We're comfortable with the knowledge that she's getting a degree of aftercare by what we can see in the interview itself. She has a reaction, she has thoughts, she has likes and dislikes.

Case in point is <a href=\"http://pandorablake.com/blog/\">Pandora Blake</a>, who runs and stars in <a href=\"http://www.dreamsofspanking.com\">Dreams Of Spanking</a>. She is a genuine fetishist. The models, both submissive and dominant, are genuine fetishists. Everything you see is very clearly a mutually agreed fantasy that everyone involved is benefitting from. That's what porn should be - positive people doing positive things that they benefit from, shared with the viewer within a consensual and ethical framework.</p>\n<p>A now-defunct site called Insex used to be one of my mainstays for imaginative, devious and downright raw BDSM content. PD, the top who ran the site, was an evil genius.</p>\n<p>The crew behind Insex produced a documentary - Graphic Sexual Horror - about its rise and fall. At its height, Insex was an ethical BDSM powerhouse - PD and one of the models even began a relationship. The things that started its downfall, related with surprising honesty in the documentary, were violations of consent and issues of safety. PD crossed a pre-agreed line with one model. Corners were cut on the manufacturing of a glass-walled water tank causing it to rupture and smash, fortunately without anyone inside.</p>\n<p>The video that featured the model whose consent was violated instantly changed in my mind. Once a favourite, for a long time I couldn't watch it. I decided to pull it up recently out of curiosity - how would I see something that used to be so unremittingly stimulating?</p>\n<p>The answer was disgust and intense empathy. It was a deeply unsexy experience. With consent removed, I saw abuse, and as with most kinky people, abuse is the ultimate abhorrence in a scene where consent is so important.</p>\n<p>That's what's matters. Porn isn't an inherently bad thing. Watching people doing something that you enjoy in order to enjoy it vicariously is not an inherently bad thing. The issue is one of abuse, safety, consent, and honesty.</p>\n<p>I took the opportunity of being an extra in a gay BDSM shoot once. It wasn't hot to me, but it was incredibly eye-opening. The 'straight' submissive being 'abducted' and dominated by the group of gay men was genuinely straight. He wasn't getting off on it - he was in it for the money.

He safeworded once; it was immediately honoured, after which he chose to resume the scene. It was made absolutely clear to him (and the extras) that any of us could walk away at any point and be paid pro rata for however much material had been filmed. He was interviewed afterwards. There was no coercion or genuine force used - this was a man choosing to do something of his own free will in exchange for financial gain, just like any job.</p>\n<p>Well, alright, there were potentially more latex-covered pool cues applied internally than in <em>most</em> fields of employment, but you see what I mean.</p>\n<p>I was thoroughly impressed, and I genuinely hope that it's typical of responsible porn producers. Show me what these people think of doing what I just saw. Show me that they enjoyed it. Show me that they have opinions. It's not just a matter of feeling better about myself, it improves the experience because it lets me identify with them. Show me two (hey, or more, I'm no prude) people doing something that they <em>want</em> to do. I don't care what it is; if it's something that doesn't turn me on, I won't watch it.

In the moment, she was an object, and that itself was hot - but now she's a person who enjoyed doing it, and that's *even hotter*.\\n\\nI've just described the usual structure of a video from one of the [kink.com](http://www.kink.com) sites. The material that Kink produce is some of the best, hottest porn that I've ever, er, *researched*. I want to know that everyone involved is having a good time, even if on the surface what's happening is far from hugs and kisses.\\n\\nSome of my friends run porn sites. Case in point is [Pandora Blake](http://pandorablake.com/blog/), who runs and stars in [Dreams Of Spanking](http://www.dreamsofspanking.com). She is a genuine fetishist. The models, both submissive and dominant, are genuine fetishists. Everything you see is very clearly a mutually agreed fantasy that everyone involved is benefitting from. That's what porn should be - positive people doing positive things that they benefit from, shared with the viewer within a consensual and ethical framework.\\n\\nA now-defunct site called Insex used to be one of my mainstays for imaginative, devious and downright raw BDSM content. PD, the top who ran the site, was an evil genius.\\n\\nThe crew behind Insex produced a documentary - Graphic Sexual Horror - about its rise and fall. At its height, Insex was an ethical BDSM powerhouse - PD and one of the models even began a relationship. The things that started its downfall, related with surprising honesty in the documentary, were violations of consent and issues of safety. PD crossed a pre-agreed line with one model. Corners were cut on the manufacturing of a glass-walled water tank causing it to rupture and smash, fortunately without anyone inside.\\n\\nThe video that featured the model whose consent was violated instantly changed in my mind. Once a favourite, for a long time I couldn't watch it. I decided to pull it up recently out of curiosity - how would I see something that used to be so unremittingly stimulating?\\n\\nThe answer was disgust and intense empathy. It was a deeply unsexy experience. With consent removed, I saw abuse, and as with most kinky people, abuse is the ultimate abhorrence in a scene where consent is so important.\\n\\nThat's what's matters. Porn isn't an inherently bad thing. Watching people doing something that you enjoy in order to enjoy it vicariously is not an inherently bad thing. The issue is one of abuse, safety, consent, and honesty.\\n\\nI took the opportunity of being an extra in a gay BDSM shoot once. It wasn't hot to me, but it was incredibly eye-opening. The 'straight' submissive being 'abducted' and dominated by the group of gay men was genuinely straight. He wasn't getting off on it - he was in it for the money. That in itself isn't a bad thing.\\n\\nWhat appeared in the final video aside, he was continuously cared for throughout. He safeworded once; it was immediately honoured, after which he chose to resume the scene. It was made absolutely clear to him (and the extras) that any of us could walk away at any point and be paid pro rata for however much material had been filmed. He was interviewed afterwards. There was no coercion or genuine force used - this was a man choosing to do something of his own free will in exchange for financial gain, just like any job.\\n\\nWell, alright, there were potentially more latex-covered pool cues applied internally than in *most* fields of employment, but you see what I mean.\\n\\nI was thoroughly impressed, and I genuinely hope that it's typical of responsible porn producers. Show me what these people think of doing what I just saw. Show me that they enjoyed it. Show me that they have opinions. It's not just a matter of feeling better about myself, it improves the experience because it lets me identify with them. Show me two (hey, or more, I'm no prude) people doing something that they *want* to do. I don't care what it is; if it's something that doesn't turn me on, I won't watch it. What matters is that it's executed with informed consent and genuine freedom - because when it is, it's beautiful.\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}"

What I am going to cover is the details of the filtering that is already in place (and has been for some time now), and the technical reasons why a filter like this will do more harm than good.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wealreadyhaveachildabusefilter\">We already have a child abuse filter</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.iwf.org.uk/\" title=\"Internet Watch Foundation\">Internet Watch Foundation</a> serves two purposes. Firstly, it provides a clearinghouse for reports of child abuse content online, and secondly, it produces a list of sites hosting such content, which is used by an existing filter called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleanfeed_(content_blocking_system)\" title=\"Cleanfeed (content blocking system)\">Cleanfeed</a> that is used by most UK ISPs.</p>\n<p>It's far from perfect. The most memorable false positive was the blocking of a Wikipedia article about the Scorpions' album <em>Virgin Killer</em>. The cover art features a nude ten-year-old girl, with her genitalia obscured by a shattered glass effect. Whether or not you believe that's acceptable, it is not illegal content. The IWF felt otherwise – that there were erotic undertones – and classified it as 'erotic posing with no sexual activity'.</p>\n<p>Wikipedia editors are nothing if not obsessive about their subject matter. It didn't take long for someone to notice, and the IWF removed the image from their list three days later.</p>\n<p>Cleanfeed, in collaboration with the IWF, is already a default-on filter for child abuse content. Whether you're in favour of it or not, it exists, and has been active since 2004.</p>\n<h2 id=\"filterscanneverbeperfect\">Filters can never be perfect</h2>\n<p>Whenever you use an automated system (or even a human system) to process data, you will get errors. Entropy can't be eliminated. What you can do, however, is change the design of that system to eliminate or enormously reduce false positives or false negatives. Importantly, you have to pick one – you can't have both.</p>\n<p>If you're building a car alarm, you want to favour false positives. A false negative could result in the car being stolen, and a false positive could result in the car owner having to get out of bed to disable it. Favouring false positives and reducing false negatives enhances the system.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, there are times that you want to favour false negatives. Consider an automatic gun turret that supports other armed guards. If the gun turret fails to identify an attacker and as such does not fire, the armed guards are still around to deal with the situation. If, however, the gun turret identifies a friendly guard as an attacker and fires, it will kill them.</p>\n<p>Internet filters usually filter favouring false positives, due to the huge, varied, and constantly increasing number of ways to evade filtering. A false negative will let the content in question through, whereas a false positive will block it.</p>\n<p>Let's consider the various types of filter, and why a filter favouring false positives that you have to explicitly disable is a bad idea.</p>\n<h3 id=\"imageandvideocontentfilters\">Image and video content filters</h3>\n<p>These are the smartest filters around. Rather than working on a list of known illegal content, they can analyse an image or video and make a fairly decent guess about what it contains. The simplest example of this is looking for the ratio of skin tones to other colours – adult content usually has naked people in it, resulting in a much higher ratio.</p>\n<p>This is flawed for the simple reason that nudity is not inherently adult content. Art nude paintings, photography, and cinematography will also trigger this type of filter. Sex education material suffers the same fate. Even photos of patches of skin, for example medical illustrations, will trigger it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"textcontentfilters\">Text content filters</h3>\n<p>These scan the text of the resource being accessed for keywords. They can either operate by blocking if a single 'bad' keyword is found, or by analysing the ratio of 'bad' keywords to 'clean' text.</p>\n<p>We again run into problems. Medical textbooks will trigger this kind of filter, as will a lot of literature that involves sexual activity or discussion. Sex education resources have no chance. LGBT community and activism, along with rape survivor resources, have a long history of falling foul of text content filtering.</p>\n<h3 id=\"urlfilters\">URL filters</h3>\n<p>These web-only filters scan the address of the resource being accessed. Usually they'll be matched against a whitelist (anything not explicitly allowed is blocked) or a blacklist (everything not explicitly blocked is allowed). Cleanfeed uses this as one of its two filtering methods, operating in blacklist mode.</p>\n<p>Operating such a filter in whitelist mode would be completely impractical for what's being proposed, so let's focus on the problems with blacklists. The short version is that they're actually pretty good, if the people building the blacklists are honest and attentive – unfortunately, they're extremely labour-intensive and as such expensive to maintain, so the quality slips and material that shouldn't be included makes its way into the blacklist.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ipfilters\">IP filters</h3>\n<p>These operate similarly to URL filters, and is the second filtering method used by Cleanfeed. Instead of blocking a page, or an image, or a video, the entire site is blocked. They operate in whitelist or blacklist mode as mentioned in the <strong>URL filters</strong> section above, and suffer from the same problems.</p>\n<h2 id=\"peoplewontunderstandhowtooptout\">People won't understand how to opt out</h2>\n<p>Not everyone has technical ability. Many users, when presented with a 'this content has been blocked' message (or, in Cleanfeed's case, a false 'not found' error message) won't know what to do. Falsely blocked material will therefore be unavailable to them – and, as we've discussed, that will include innocent content and content that it is very important that certain people (LGBT people, rape survivors, and similar) <em>can</em> access.</p>\n<h2 id=\"optoutgivesawaycompromisinginformation\">'Opt-out' gives away compromising information</h2>\n<p>A system in which you have to opt in allows the organisation managing the filter to know that you want content filtering. The implications of this are perhaps that you have children, or you simply don't want adult content appearing as you browse. Nothing sensitive.</p>\n<p>In contrast, a system in which you have to explicitly opt out of tells the same organisation a far juicier detail – you consume adult content. Of course, it might not be adult content, but that's irrelevant. That kind of socially compromising information has a long history of being abused, and in the situation of a future far-right-wing government having access to that information, your liberty is immediately threatened.</p>\n<p>As an example, O2 and Vodafone have an opt-out filter for adult content on their mobile web platform. What proportion of the customer base impacted by it have disabled it, do you think? Your options are to make a payment from a credit (not debit) card, or visit a store with identification and ask someone face-to-face. Fortunately, I'm rather shameless, but this kind of embarrassment-based social pressure is the kind of crap that we tried to leave behind with the Victorians.</p>\n<h2 id=\"itwontwork\">It won't work</h2>\n<p>The Internet was originally designed to provide a communications network that would survive a nuclear assault. It routes around damage, and it sees censorship as damage. The people who want to share truly reprehensible material will continue to be able to do so. I won't go into detail, but I can immediately think of four different ways to achieve this (and there are more) that would be unaffected by any kind of filter based on anything but a whitelist – and, as I mentioned earlier, a whitelist is completely impractical for a nationwide filtering system. It's pretty impractical for even a family-wide filter.</p>\n<h2 id=\"filteringtechnologyitselfdoesnotcarewhatitsfiltering\">Filtering technology itself does not care what it's filtering</h2>\n<p>If you can filter one category of content, you can filter another. With this system in place, an authoritarian government would be able to filter anything they chose. We already see this in China – opposition politics, political satire, anything that is decided to be 'undesirable' can be blocked.</p>\n<h2 id=\"anyfilteringtechnologyisalwaysalsomonitoringtechnology\">Any filtering technology is always also monitoring technology</h2>\n<p>Filtering technology requires interception and analysis of communication. Co-opting this platform to inspect and monitor the same communication is trivially simple. You wouldn't stand for a government that opened all your post, so why would you stand for this?</p>\n<h2 id=\"dontbefooled\">Don't be fooled</h2>\n<p>This is a move designed to court the tabloids and gain votes. It will harm people. No matter how much the language is couched in justifications of 'protection', remember that it is a move that will be inordinately expensive, has a huge number of unavoidable drawbacks, and does not provide any significant improvement over what we already have in place – so it's unfit for purpose, too.</p>\n</div>",

Cleanfeed uses this as one of its two filtering methods, operating in blacklist mode.\\n\\nOperating such a filter in whitelist mode would be completely impractical for what's being proposed, so let's focus on the problems with blacklists. The short version is that they're actually pretty good, if the people building the blacklists are honest and attentive – unfortunately, they're extremely labour-intensive and as such expensive to maintain, so the quality slips and material that shouldn't be included makes its way into the blacklist.\\n\\n### IP filters\\n\\nThese operate similarly to URL filters, and is the second filtering method used by Cleanfeed. Instead of blocking a page, or an image, or a video, the entire site is blocked. They operate in whitelist or blacklist mode as mentioned in the **URL filters** section above, and suffer from the same problems.\\n\\n## People won't understand how to opt out\\n\\nNot everyone has technical ability. Many users, when presented with a 'this content has been blocked' message (or, in Cleanfeed's case, a false 'not found' error message) won't know what to do. Falsely blocked material will therefore be unavailable to them – and, as we've discussed, that will include innocent content and content that it is very important that certain people (LGBT people, rape survivors, and similar) *can* access.\\n\\n## 'Opt-out' gives away compromising information\\n\\nA system in which you have to opt in allows the organisation managing the filter to know that you want content filtering. The implications of this are perhaps that you have children, or you simply don't want adult content appearing as you browse. Nothing sensitive.\\n\\nIn contrast, a system in which you have to explicitly opt out of tells the same organisation a far juicier detail – you consume adult content. Of course, it might not be adult content, but that's irrelevant. That kind of socially compromising information has a long history of being abused, and in the situation of a future far-right-wing government having access to that information, your liberty is immediately threatened.\\n\\nAs an example, O2 and Vodafone have an opt-out filter for adult content on their mobile web platform. What proportion of the customer base impacted by it have disabled it, do you think? Your options are to make a payment from a credit (not debit) card, or visit a store with identification and ask someone face-to-face. Fortunately, I'm rather shameless, but this kind of embarrassment-based social pressure is the kind of crap that we tried to leave behind with the Victorians.\\n\\n## It won't work\\n\\nThe Internet was originally designed to provide a communications network that would survive a nuclear assault. It routes around damage, and it sees censorship as damage. The people who want to share truly reprehensible material will continue to be able to do so. I won't go into detail, but I can immediately think of four different ways to achieve this (and there are more) that would be unaffected by any kind of filter based on anything but a whitelist – and, as I mentioned earlier, a whitelist is completely impractical for a nationwide filtering system. It's pretty impractical for even a family-wide filter.\\n\\n## Filtering technology itself does not care what it's filtering\\n\\nIf you can filter one category of content, you can filter another. With this system in place, an authoritarian government would be able to filter anything they chose. We already see this in China – opposition politics, political satire, anything that is decided to be 'undesirable' can be blocked.\\n\\n## Any filtering technology is always also monitoring technology\\n\\nFiltering technology requires interception and analysis of communication. Co-opting this platform to inspect and monitor the same communication is trivially simple. You wouldn't stand for a government that opened all your post, so why would you stand for this?\\n\\n## Don't be fooled\\n\\nThis is a move designed to court the tabloids and gain votes. It will harm people. No matter how much the language is couched in justifications of 'protection', remember that it is a move that will be inordinately expensive, has a huge number of unavoidable drawbacks, and does not provide any significant improvement over what we already have in place – so it's unfit for purpose, too.\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}"

No.\\n\\nBut, the fact remains, the darknet is where any self-respecting child-abusing scumbag goes to do whatever it is that child-abusing scumbags do, and the filters that are being rolled out do not inspect it.\\n\\n# Tin foil hats at the ready\\n\\nThis is about two things; courting votes by letting tabloids make policy – the Daily Mail has been all over this one since the beginning – and control of information flow. When you have a centralised location that is able to control what content the vast majority of the online public is able to see, by selling it as a positive way to 'protect children', you can control what they can read about.\\n\\nThe Government can declare a group a 'terrorist organisation' or 'hate group'. It seems natural that the sites of those groups would be listed in the filters. The question is, of course, what stops them from using that measure against any group that threatens their power or even disagrees with them? We've already seen the Conservatives erase their pre-election promises from the Web, so clearly revisionism is not a problem for them.\\n\\nThey may not do this. Cameron may simply be deluded into thinking that this will end child abuse for good. The problem is, though, that by building these massive filtering architectures, we hand control over content filtering to unaccountable (and unnamed) 'third parties' where before we had the control ourselves.\\n\\nMy own personal views aside, I can understand the human desire to control what kind of content flows into a family home. For years, software has existed to do the same thing that these remote filters are doing, except in the home, and under the control of the family itself. If you want to open it up, you open it up. You don't have to tell a 'third party' that you actively want to access pornography, or information about weapons, or download Justin Bieber's latest abomination.\\n\\n# Some sites should never be blocked\\n\\nNo, it really is that simple. The Samaritans, for example. Childline. Resources for those enduring domestic abuse, or child abuse, or human trafficking. Sex education. LGBTQ resources. There are certainly more. Consider the situation in which an abuser controls the filter, and ensures that their victim is unable to reach out for help.\\n\\n# Conversation is better than silence\\n\\nThe Internet is about free flow of information. There's no actual evidence that pornography has a denigratory effect on children in the first place. Sex education is important to establish the falsehood of pornography and the criticality of consent and respect for partners. Blocking it all is the same logic as abstinence-only sex education; it ensures that when kids find out about it (and I promise you, they will go looking) they get their information from the sketchy sites able to slip through the filter – or, worse, darknet content.\\n\\nIf you're tempted to use these filters to 'protect' your kids, reconsider. Talk to your kids, don't wall them off. Conversations about sex can be difficult, but they are going to come across pornography at some point, and if they have an understanding that their sexual nature is part of being human, that pornography is a staged, false version of sex full of smoke and mirrors, and that in the real world safety, consent, communication, and laughter are all part of a healthy sex life, does it really matter what they see online?\\n\\nResist anything that chooses wilful ignorance over education and discussion.\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}"

The democratisation of learning that the Internet has brought has changed things. To move backward and deny them a voice cannot end well. Not to mention that individuality produces innovation  -  you can't expect excellence when you're doing everything you can to force every child in your care into your outdated vision of an obedient, unquestioning drone.</p>\n<p>What can we do about it? I'm not sure, to be honest. The Free Schools programme leaves them extremely insulated from accountability.

Michaela's policy is everything an abuser\ncould possibly want.\n\nEducation is a field in which many people have very different opinion. Ask ten\npeople how it should be handled and you'll get ten different answers. What's\nimportant to remember here is that Michaela is state-funded. Your tax pays for\nit. While most would presume that publicly-funded organisations should be\nexpected to conform to evidence-based policies based on the consensus of experts\nin the field, this is not the case with Free Schools.\n\nSchools like Michaela are experiments, with children as the guinea pigs.\n\nChildren today have more agency in their upbringing than ever before. The\ndemocratisation of learning that the Internet has brought has changed things. To\nmove backward and deny them a voice cannot end well. Not to mention that\nindividuality produces innovation  -  you can't expect excellence when you're\ndoing everything you can to force every child in your care into your outdated\nvision of an obedient, unquestioning drone.\n\nWhat can we do about it? I'm not sure, to be honest. The Free Schools programme\nleaves them extremely insulated from accountability. The only organisation that\nmight have powers to step in would be Ofsted, but I'm unsure what even they\nwould be able to do.\n\nSo, I'll leave it open to you. Do you have an educational background? Are you\nfamiliar with the legalities of the Free Schools programme? Are you a Michaela\nparent, or even a Michaela student, and want to share your thoughts and\nexperiences?\n\nIf so, please post a comment, or drop me an email to dave@dave.io  if you'd\nrather speak privately. If you want to share something in confidence and/or\nanonymously, please use email and say so in your message.\n\nLet's leave Victorian-style education where it belongs  -  in the increasingly\ndistant past.",

I'll save you my own sob story, but let's just say it was a deeply unpleasant experience. Michaela, however, is one of the Tory government's \\\"[Free Schools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_school_%28England%29)\\\"  -  schools which don't charge parents a fee, instead having won a bid for public money. They're funded by the taxpayer, but they aren't under the control of the local authority. They're essentially unaccountable to anyone but Ofsted, whose powers are very limited.\\n\\nSo here's a video, shared by the school itself, in which Boris Johnson spends eight and a half painful minutes extolling its virtues.\\n\\n<iframe width=\\\"560\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2TI42MJPk3c\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\nIn the school's own words -\\n\\n> Michaela Community School is a non-denominational, non-fee paying, 11 - 18, mixed Free School which opened in Wembley Park in September 2014.\\n>\\n> Michaela brings the values and advantages of a private education to young people of all backgrounds by providing a highly academic curriculum and strong discipline.\\n\\nHaving experienced the 'values' and 'advantages' of a private education which glorified 'strong discipline', these two paragraphs palpably raise my blood pressure. Alarm bells begin to ring.\\n\\nOnce I see a piece of fluffy praise shared by one of the teachers, one which reads like the script for a cult recruitment video, those alarm bells get louder.\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"twitter-tweet\\\" data-lang=\\\"en\\\"><p lang=\\\"en\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Today&#39;s lunch topic was to sum up Michaela in precisely 10 words ❤️ <a href=\\\"https://t.co/3teWVBwUwv\\\">pic.twitter.com/3teWVBwUwv</a></p>&mdash; Bodil Isaksen (@BodilUK) <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/BodilUK/status/740875934971101185\\\">June 9, 2016</a></blockquote>\\n<script async src=\\\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\\\" charset=\\\"utf-8\\\"></script>\\n\\nThen I found another staff member who had shared a piece of feedback which he received from one of his students -\\n\\n![](/content/images/2016/08/1-0VZxwtpzj5dQ4ooyXvXzgg.jpeg)\\n\\n*\\\"Before I used to be extremely lazy in French and I continuously did not put my hand up, but I redeemed myself.\\\"* Children do not write this kind of thing about their teachers unless prompted or coerced. Note that the student's name, while obscured, is included here. The idea of soliciting feedback in a non-anonymous form (and remember, even without names, handwriting would be an easy way to identify a student's feedback) and expecting it to be objective and truthful is absurd.\\n\\nAs it turns out, the teacher who shared that feedback, Barry Smith, is Michaela's Deputy Head. He has [his own blog](https://hackingattheroots.wordpress.com), and it is chock full of worrying statements.\\n\\n# Silence, chanting, and rote learning\\n\\n> The kids go to the 4th floor at 1.30 to get changed. They change in silence. They then read in silence until everyone in the changing room is ready.\\n>\\n> I say 'silence' and some of you are imagining oppression, coercion, child cruelty. It's really not.\\n>\\n> Some of the time we'll not actually be silent. We could be chanting Kipling or a bit of Shakespeare or Invictus or Ozymandias. Often teachers are firing questions at the kids. These could be science, French, maths  -  it really depends who is on changing room duty.\\n\\nChildren are being taught Invictus by rote. They are expected to chant it out together instead of talking to each other, or not talking at all. It's Victorian. This isn't during class time, it's when they are _changing clothes_. Mindless repetition is used to fill their cognitive capacity. Can you name any real-world benefit to memorising poetry? We're not talking about studying and analysing it, we're talking about mindless rote learning.\\n\\n# Unquestioning obedience to authority\\n\\n> At first, it'll feel a bit weird for some of you working in silence and following the text with your ruler. I don't care. That's how we do it in this class. The first couple of minutes might feel odd, you might be going, \\\"Head hurts! I hates Mr Smith! He does my 'ead in!\\\" The first few questions might be hard, the next few will be a bit easier for you, the next few a bit easier again and, by the end, you'll be begging me for more work, you'll be loving it so much! I promise! I'd never lie to you! Trust me! I'm a teacher!\\n>\\n> I'm an adult. I automatically have, or should have, authority over kids.\\n>\\n> Some of you hate that concept, I imagine. Sorry if it offends. But I'm not going to lie to you. We're grown-ups, they're kids. It's not a democracy, I am a dictator, a benevolent dictator, but it's my job to protect kids from their worst excesses. It's my job to lead that lesson. As I see it.\\n\\n*\\\"I promise! I'd never lie to you! Trust me! I'm a teacher!\\\"* These are statements that no child should ever be compelled to believe. My schooling taught that teachers were infallible. It never even occurred to me that I *could* question what they said, it just had to be obeyed. Looking back, there was a huge quantity of outright bullying from teacher to student. A child should *never, ever* be told that *anyone* else is infallible. To do so teaches them that they have no power over their own lives.\\n\\n> Do you ever have a lesson and get kind of goose bumpy? Shocked at just how thoroughly lovely and biddable and compliant kids can be? (I chose those words very deliberately. I like kids doing what they're told.) Well, it was like that. This history lesson was like one of those \\\"Hey, become a teacher! It's great! kids love learning stuff!\\\" adverts. Only it was true!!\\n\\nGetting goosebumps from children being 'compliant' and 'biddable'? I am not comfortable with that at all.\\n\\n# How students view teaching staff\\n\\n> Some kids, depending upon the culture of the school, think that teachers, just by virtue of their job title, are there to be abused. Some of these same kids throw stones at policemen and firemen and ambulance men. These kids have learnt to be anti-authority and they've learnt not to **fear** consequences. Do I want kids living in **fear**? Well, a bit, yeah.\\n\\nEmphasis from original. He actually, genuinely chose to stress the word 'fear'.\\n\\n# Mental wellbeing of students\\n\\nBarry Smith does not consider students to be capable of experiencing pressure and stress.\\n\\n> I really don't like all this talk of 'intolerable pressure' and 'stress' on school kids.\\n>\\n> In my experience most kids are bone idle unless you're right on top of them. They're not stressed out. They're making excuses for lack of self-control.\\n>\\n> If kids at Michaela don't do homework, and this is monitored very tightly, they are guaranteed a detention. The kids know. There is no escape. There is no doubt. There is no 'stress'.\\n>\\n> If kids break the rules twice in a lesson, this could be fiddling with your pen and then later on turning around to smirk at a mate, they'll get a detention. Guaranteed. No escape. No doubt. No uncertainty. No 'stress'.\\n>\\n> Does that sound like 'intolerable pressure' to you?\\n>\\n> We don't do 'tea & sympathy' we do 'pull your socks up!'\\n>\\n> We'll help you pull your socks up, but we won't let you make excuses.\\n\\nThis is how schools used to work. As time progressed, we realised that childrens' mental health was not only a serious concern, but also a barrier to learning in many cases. We started to try to incorporate better ways of doing things. What we didn't do was stick our heels in the mud and declare that mental health issues were simply disobedience.\\n\\nLet's also address the 'no excuses' discipline that Michaela prizes so highly. This assumes that teachers, or other adults capable of administering punishment, are universally correct, informed, and well-intentioned. They aren't. 'No excuses' is code for unquestioning obedience to unaccountable authority simply because it is defined as authority.\\n\\n![](/content/images/2016/08/1-xZ-3EHOaQnUxT__XRTDBqw-1.jpg)\\n\\nThis is what children are learning. Any expression of agency is \\\"whinging\\\". If that's not a recipe for unaccountable authority, then I don't know what is.\\n\\n# Rejection of the 'new'\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"twitter-tweet\\\" data-lang=\\\"en\\\"><p lang=\\\"en\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Dynamic!

In particular, I'm not surprised to see that word  -  'aspire'  -  showing up. 'Aspirational' is a Tory buzzword  -  one which says that any failings in your life are down to your own lack of hard work, and putting any blame on external factors like systemic racism, sexism, or class divides is a cop-out.\\n\\nMy traditionalist education held a dim view on technology of any kind, and the Internet in particular. Expensive facilities went underused as ideology trumped reality. As a result, I'm particularly apt to notice the same kinds of sentiment in other educational institutions. The Michaela website has plenty about their core syllabus of 'traditional' subjects  -  maths, languages, science  -  but not a word about IT or computing.\\n\\nThat is, until you read their blog post about their cyberbullying policy. This is a long one, so emphasis is added for clarity.\\n\\n>Social networking can be addictive, massively time-consuming and, quite frankly, vicious. That's why we insist that every single Michaela parent monitors their child's use of the Internet very closely. **No Michaela pupil should ever have more than two hours per day of screen time, be that TV, Internet, games consoles, texting or any form of social networking.** It's simply too easy to send a message or a photo in the heat of the moment that one might later regret.\\n>\\n>By far the easiest way to keep your child safe, happy and free from bullying, is to **restrict and monitor their screen time and to simply ban them from social networking sites**. Rather than fritter time away on social networking, or playing computer games, **encourage your child to take up a sport or other character-building pastime**. And remember too our message at Michaela  -  'the more we read, the more we know.'\\n>\\n>Through firm but fair discipline and a **100% ban on mobile phones** we will keep your child safe at school but, to keep your child safe when s/he is not at school, every single parent must monitor their child's Internet usage and texting. As the adults in their lives we need to protect them through clear parameters consistently applied  -  there is no other way. One day they'll thank you for it.\\n>\\n> Our advice is:\\n>\\n> **No child should have access to a Facebook account**\\n>\\n> Families must discuss, be vigilant, and if necessary, ban their children from using, social network sites.\\n>\\n> Let's encourage our children to have **healthy hobbies**, to read, to sit with us around the dinner table in discussion and to watch the news with us  -  together as a family.\\n>\\n> Let's not allow our children to become isolated, obsessed by social networking, texting, computer games  - **activities that isolate and break the family connection**.\\n\\nThe message is clear. Children should be taking up *\\\"a sport or other character-building pastime\\\"*. An interest in technology is not \\\"character-building\\\".\\n\\nThere's more to this, though  -  note that isolation from extracurricular social media means the school's message, alongside any parental message, is undiluted. When you cut a child off from competing worldviews, it becomes much easier to form the worldview you want. Also, remember that this kind of restricted communication makes it much harder for a child to seek outside help in a situation where they are being abused. Michaela's policy is everything an abuser could possibly want.\\n\\nEducation is a field in which many people have very different opinion. Ask ten people how it should be handled and you'll get ten different answers. What's important to remember here is that Michaela is state-funded. Your tax pays for it. While most would presume that publicly-funded organisations should be expected to conform to evidence-based policies based on the consensus of experts in the field, this is not the case with Free Schools.\\n\\nSchools like Michaela are experiments, with children as the guinea pigs.\\n\\nChildren today have more agency in their upbringing than ever before.

    "mobiledoc": "{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"Perverts are people too, you know. Well, at least they are in between periods of time spent as puppies, ponies or coffee tables. And, because of that, at some point most of us want to find someone (or another someone - I'm not leaving polyamorists out here) to have an emotional relationship and share our lives both inside and outside kink with.\\n\\nUnfortunately, kink dating is fraught with potential disaster. A good example is CollarMe, which is designed for bringing perverts together. What it actually is, is a mess of fake profiles, professionals touting for business and inactive account city. Some have had success with CollarMe - congratulations if that's the case. My point here is that you're in the minority.\\n\\nOther sites, like FetLife (which is my favourite kinky social network by far), aren't really designed for meeting people. Some attempt to use the groups feature to do so, but generally that results in a moderator smackdown, depending on the group's rules.\\n\\nSo, that leaves us with vanilla dating sites. That's right - strap in, everyone. Now entering bat country.\\n\\n# What could possibly go wrong?\\n\\nThe problem is this. If you're looking for a long term relationship, you don't want to get involved with someone who just cares about the sex. On the other hand, you do want a sex life, and for kinky people in a vanilla crowd, you want to know if you're going to end up with your future Non Gender Specific Life Partner fleeing after you crack out the violet wand. Because of this, it's often one of the first topics that kinky people dating in a mainly vanilla environment bring up - and it's one of the main reasons that they find themselves ignored or blocked by a potential match.\\n\\nThe good news is there are ways to mitigate this problem.\\n\\n# Finding a needleplayer in a haystack\\n\\nI'm a long term user of OKCupid.com - it's a brilliant dating site that is mostly aimed at geeks (and I use the term as a compliment). The key thing that makes it useful to kinky people is that its \\\"Q&A\\\" matching mechanic means that you can find out a lot of someone's key beliefs and opinions before you even send them a message.\\n\\nI find that, having answered a load of their questions myself, people shown as a 90% match or greater are almost always kinky. If OKCupid decides that they're kinky enough, they even get it mentioned on their personality metrics - but that said, an absence of that bar does not mean they're not a pervert. OKCupid, like any automated system, sometimes gets it wrong.\\n\\nWhat's also quite nice is that if you sign up for their paid service, A-List, you can actually order your search results by kinkiness. A nice touch.\\n\\nSo, armed with this information, you can pick and choose who you contact. Now, there's no need to bring up that you're kinky and look like a sex pest - mention it on your profile so that they can see what you're into, and qualify it by explaining at you're not just after a play partner in the same paragraph.\\n\\nThe point here is that eventually, you're going to talk about sex, and that's absolutely brilliant. It usually shouldn't be the first thing to bring up, though, or you'll end up looking like the hundreds of hormonally-driven troglodytes that frequent Internet dating sites - so if you can find out how kinky a potential match is to start with, then you needn't wonder about wasting your time or freaking them out.\\n\\n# Kinky dating on vanilla sites: Dos and Don'ts\\n\\n#### Do -\\n\\n- Be upfront on your profile about your kink. No need for a full list of what you're into, but perhaps (in OKCupid's case) mention something like 'kink' or 'BDSM' under \\\"Things I couldn't do without\\\".\\n- Link your FetLife / other kinky social network profile from your online dating profile so that kinky matches reading it can find you on there too.\\n- Mention that you were at a fetish club a few weeks ago (or say something similar) into conversation - but only if it can be said as part of the natural flow of the conversation.

It will happen - and you do not want to a) be a dick or b) get a reputation for being a dick. \\\"I'm sorry to hear that, but fair enough and I wish you well\\\" is a good response.\\n- Be very clear about the privacy implications of maintaining a profile. Vanilla dating sites are often a lot more open to the public (and Google) than you'd expect from something like FetLife.\\n\\n#### Don't -\\n\\n- Let your discussion of kink on your profile take over the rest of it. It's a part of your life, but you're not just looking for a play partner here.

This data is also signed and immutable by anyone but the signer.\\n\\n# Approaches\\n\\nIn the following diagrams, which depict a sequence of events, time runs from top to bottom.\\n\\n## Weak anonymity, weak security\\n\\n<div class=\\\"mermaid\\\">\\nsequenceDiagram\\n\\tparticipant User\\n\\tparticipant Website\\n\\tparticipant AVS\\n\\tparticipant Government\\n\\tUser->>+Website: User's PII\\n\\tWebsite->>+AVS: User's PII\\n\\tAVS->>+Government: User's PII\\n\\tGovernment-->>-AVS: PII verify response\\n\\tAVS-->>-Website: PII verify response\\n\\tWebsite-->>-User: Yes/no response\\n</div>\\n\\n### Pros\\n\\n* Simple and intuitive process.\\n\\n### Cons\\n\\n* All entities receive the user's PII, increasing the risk of unauthorised disclosure.\\n* At least AVS, but possibly Government too, can associate a human with a list of the Websites they use.\\n\\n## Weak anonymity, strong security\\n\\n<div class=\\\"mermaid\\\">\\nsequenceDiagram\\n\\tparticipant User\\n\\tparticipant Website\\n\\tparticipant AVS\\n\\tparticipant Government\\n\\tUser->>+AVS: User's PII\\n\\tAVS->>+Government: User's PII\\n\\tGovernment-->>-AVS: PII verify response\\n\\tAVS-->>-User: Token\\n\\tUser->>+Website: Token\\n\\tWebsite->>+AVS: Token verify request\\n\\tAVS-->>-Website: Token verify response\\n\\tWebsite-->>-User: Yes/no response\\n</div>\\n\\n### Pros\\n\\n* User's PII is never sent to Website, avoiding a significant potential point of unauthorised disclosure. User does not even have to give Website their real name, unless required for billing purposes.\\n\\n### Cons\\n\\n* Increased complexity - User must know that they need to get a token separately to signing up.\\n* At least AVS, but possibly Government too, can associate a human with a list of the Websites they use.\\n\\n## Strong anonymity, strong security\\n\\n<div class=\\\"mermaid\\\">\\nsequenceDiagram\\n\\tparticipant User\\n\\tparticipant Website\\n\\tparticipant AVS\\n\\tparticipant Government\\n\\tUser->>+AVS: User's PII + certificate request\\n\\tAVS->>+Government: User's PII\\n\\tGovernment-->>-AVS: PII verify response\\n\\tNote over AVS: Build certificate response if PII is valid\\n\\tAVS-->>-User: Certificate response\\n\\tNote over User: Build final certificate from request and signed response\\n\\tNote over User: Store final certificate\\n\\tUser->>+Website: Certificate\\n\\tNote over Website: Verify certificate validity\\n\\tWebsite-->>-User: Yes/no response\\n</div>\\n\\n### Pros\\n\\n* User's PII is sent to the bare minimum of destinations, and only once per signed token validity period.\\n* AVS is not involved when Websites check the Certificate, so has no way to associate a human with a list of Websites they use.\\n* AVS can revoke compromised or erroneous Certificates using existing standards (CRL, OCSP) without compromising User's identity as long as Certificates are built using a random Token as the identifying factor (\\\"Common Name\\\").\\n\\n### Cons\\n\\n* Further complexity. Even with automation, a User needs to understand the process to some degree.\\n\\n# Building the best system\\n\\nAs we've seen in the final diagram, we can have an AVS while still respecting privacy. With a sensible validity period - a year or so would be reasonable - the only thing the AVS or Government knows is that a particular human has requested a certificate at some point.\\n\\nThe even better news is that a system like this isn't anything new or cutting-edge. It's a slight variation on the way the existing SSL/TLS infrastructure works for securing web, email, and other Internet traffic. Whenever you see a tickmark or padlock next to a website name, your browser has verified the server's certificate is signed by a list of certificate authorities that the browser trusts.\\n\\nThis is feasible.\\n\\n# Actually getting the best system\\n\\nTo make this happen, we need to apply pressure. Few Governments have ever willingly chosen to collect *less* information about their citizens when given half a chance. In an ideal world this whole idea would be abandoned, but if we are going to be stuck with it, we need to use technology to reduce its impact as much as possible.\\n\\nSupport your local privacy activists. Organisations like the [Open Rights Group](https://www.openrightsgroup.org) and [Backlash UK](https://www.backlash.org.uk), along with individuals like [Myles Jackman](http://www.mylesjackman.com) and [Pandora Blake](http://pandorablake.com/blog) are doing fantastic work. If nothing else, [write to your MP online for free](https://www.writetothem.com). We need informed Members to bring up the technical options, and we all know that Parliament's general technical understanding is horribly limited.\\n\\nAnd, of course, if you're working on this and want to bring me on board to help build the system, [my contracting rates are quite reasonable](mailto:dave@enougheyeballs.com).\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}"
